# PMR
Features to add:

**In Progress:**
1. Create an adjustment slider that edits the space between the two pipes. Turn the upper pipe and lower pipe in to separate assets and allow the distance between spawners to be edited by the slider. 
2. Edit control of the game play so that instead of "flapping" emg activity allows for a smooth 'flight' of the bird.
3. Link to EMG sensors for gameplay. 

**Future features:**

4. Allow multiple hits before death.
