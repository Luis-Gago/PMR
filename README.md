# PMR
Features to add:

**In Progress:**
1. Adjustment sliders on gameplay page (Currently have a slider that allows for live adjustment of pipe width. Unsure of how to edit space between pipes. Currently the pipes are an asset and I do not know how to create a slider that would live edit an asset.)
2. Multiple levels with different speed, size, and width of generated pipes. Different skins and backgrounds for each level. (Added a second and third level with a different color background and a faster spawn rate for the pipes.)
3. Link to EMG sensors for gameplay. (Meeting with Kunal 6/8 to link game to EMG sensors.)

**Future features:**
4. Allow multiple hits before death.
