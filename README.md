# PMR
Features to add:

1. Adjustment sliders on gameplay page (Currently have a slider that allows for live adjustment of pipe width. Unsure of how to edit space between pipes.)
2. Multiple levels with different speed, size, and width of generated pipes. Different skins and backgrounds for each level. (Added a second level with a different color background and a faster spawn rate for the pipes.)
3. Allow multiple hits before death.
4. Link to EMG sensors for gameplay
